# Getting started with scaffolds

## Walkthrough video

<div class="bg-red-100 py-1 px-5" markdown="1">
**Please note**, the video is from a previous iteration of the project, so there are some differences:

- I am using Gitpod as my cloud editor, so the interface looks a bit different.
- Anything contained in the project "README" is now contained in this Lesson
- I use a graphical user interface at the URL path `/git` to commit and push, _you_ should use [the VSCode built in workflow in this lesson](https://learn.firstdraft.com/lessons/50-git-commit-and-push)
- I use `bin/server` to start my live app preview, _you_ should use `bin/dev`
- I use `rails sample_data`, _you_ should use `rake sample_data`
- You should drop the `.html.erb` when rendering a view template:
    `render({ :template => "photo_templates/index" })` 
    _instead of_ 
    `render({ :template => "photo_templates/index.html.erb" })`)
</div>

Did you read the differences above? Good! Then [here is a walkthrough video for this project.](https://share.descript.com/view/sYmmL9OgLIN)

The lesson below contains some additional details, but the video should mostly guide you through the project.
